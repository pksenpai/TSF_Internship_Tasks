### Task - 1

In this task we were provided with a dataset that contained the amount of hours a student studied and the marks that they scored and we had to predict how much a student would score after studying for a particular amount of time. We had to apply Linear regression to find the solution.
We were able to build a decent model which made a prediction very close to the expected output and it would have been much better if we had more data.

We were also given a user input of time - 9.25 Hrs and we are supposed to make a prediction of the score.
