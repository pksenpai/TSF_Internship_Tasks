In this task we were provided with a dataset that contained the amount of hours a student studied and the marks that they scored and we had to predict how much a student would score after studying for a particular amount of time. We had to apply Linear regression to find the solution.
We were able to build a decent model which made a prediction very close to the expected output and it would have been much better if we had more data.

We were also given a user input of time - 9.25 Hrs and we are supposed to make a prediction of the score.

### Task - 6

In this task we were given the Iris data set and we were supposed to create a classifier that could classify between the various Iris species when the user gave an input. We were asked to use the decision tree algorithm in order to make the classifier.
My particular model gave an accuracy of nearly 98% with some really good f-scores and precision recall.
